Script Requires:
php5, php-cli, php-curl If you have a PHP versiln < 5.2.0 you will need the json PEAR class..  

INSTALL:

You can place this script anywhere on the system, for ease of directions
I will use '/usr/local/sbin/' change this path where referenced to the 
path that fits your needs.

1. Install the physical file
     install -m 755 tweet2call.php /usr/local/sbin
   If your PHP is < 5.2.0 you also need to do the following:
     mkdir -p /usr/local/sbin/json
     install -m 755 json/JSON.PHP /usr/local/sbin/json/
     
2. Edit the files parameters to fit you (replace nano with your editor)
     nano -w /usr/local/sbin/tweet2call.php
	 PARAMETERS:
		ONLY TOUCH BETWEEN THE "" and set according to your needs:
		
		DEPARTMENTS: A pipe "|" seperated list of departments to use
		             ie: "support|sales|foo|bar"
		BLACKLIST: The black list matches the first 3 numbers of the string
		           by default we block international, 911, 411 and other
				   numbers which you dont want an automated system dialing
				   or abused. This is also a pipe seperated list you can
				   block specific area codes as well. 
		AST_OUTGOING_DIR: This is where asterisk looks for call files
		                  The default value is the asterisk default and
						  typicaly should be left alone.
		TEMP_DIR: This script generates some temporary files specify a 
		          location where the script will have write permissions.
				  By default we ues /tmp which should be okay.
        AST_TRUNK: What trunk should generated calls go out on?
		           ie:"Zap/g0/##" or "SIP/##@your_sip_peer" 
		TWITTER_USER: The twitter user name to poll for DM's
		TWITTER_PASS: The twitter password for the above account.
		DAEMON: If you call this from a start up script to run in a loop
		        you will want to set this to 1. By default we call from cron.
		DAEMON_POLLTIME: If you are in daemon mode how often in minutes
		                 do you want the system to check for messages. 
						 Max requests to twitter for all API activities is 
						 100/HR so if you use other applications with the
						 above account take their usage in to consideration.
						 By default we check every minute which is 60
						 API calls to twitter per hour leaving 40 for 
						 other usage.
						 
Save the file, with nano you will use ctrl+x then "y" for yes and enter 
on the file name.

If you set "DAEMON" to 1 then you can call the script on bootup by adding
the following line to /etc/rc.local:
		/usr/local/sbin/tweet2call.php&
		
For Cron we will take the advise from DAEMON_POLLTIME remembering you have
100 total API calls per hour!

To add to the crontab type: crontab -e
Add the appropriate line:
To poll every minute:
		*/1 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/tweet2call.php
To poll every  5 minutes:
		*/5 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/tweet2call.php
To poll every 10 minutes:
		*/10 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/tweet2call.php
Simply replace the first number with the proper ammount of minutes.

DO NOT SET THE SCRIPT TO DAEMON MODE AND USE CRON OR THE UNIVERSE MAY IMPLODE!

Asterisk:

You need to add context to your dialplan for each department in the format:
[queue-department] the generated calls will be dropped to s,1 of that context.
The following examples are for queued systems:

[queue-support]
exten => s,1,Set(QUEUE_PRIO=10)
exten => s,n,Goto(support-queue,s,2)

[queue-sales]
exten => s,1,Set(QUEUE_PRIO=10)
exten => s,n,Goto(sales-queue,s,2)

[queue-billing]
exten => s,1,Set(QUEUE_PRIO=10)
exten => s,n,Goto(billing-queue,s,2)
		
That is pretty much it if you did the aboe stuff correctly it should work.

If you find this script or any other advice I give useful please consider
my paypal clergy12@yahoo.com .  Direct gifts are also enjoyed feel free to 
shoot an email to jfinstrom [at] gmail.com for shipping info. 

TODO/IDEAS for further improvement:
- convert to freepbx module
- add database support for blacklist
- add database driven user based blacklist

Further development of this project will depend on interest and time..


Thank you for using tweet2call
